# ================================
# Server Configuration
# ================================
server:
  port: 8083
  # The Task Submission Service will run on port 8083.
  # Example: http://localhost:8083/api/submissions

# ================================
# Spring Application Configuration
# ================================
spring:
  application:
    name: TASK-SUBMISSION-SERVICE
    # The name of this microservice.
    # Used for service discovery in Eureka and distributed tracing.
    # Other services will identify this as "TASK-SUBMISSION-SERVICE".

  mongodb:
    uri: ${MONGO_URI}
    # Connection URI for MongoDB Atlas cluster.


# ================================
# Eureka Client Configuration
# ================================
eureka:
  client:
    service-url:
      defaultZone: http://localhost:8085/eureka
      # URL of the Eureka server (service registry).
      # This microservice will register itself with Eureka at port 8085.
      # Other microservices (like TASK-SERVICE, USER-SERVICE) can discover "TASK-SUBMISSION-SERVICE" via Eureka.

# ================================
# Distributed Tracing Configuration
# ================================
management:
  tracing:
    sampling:
      probability: 1.0
      # Sampling probability for tracing.
      # 1.0 → trace 100% of requests (good for debugging, but heavy in production).

  zipkin:
    tracing:
      endpoint: "${MANAGEMENT_ZIPKIN_TRACING_ENDPOINT:http://localhost:9411/api/v2/spans}"
      # Zipkin server endpoint for collecting traces.
      # Zipkin must be running locally on port 9411.
      # This allows you to visualize request flows across microservices.
