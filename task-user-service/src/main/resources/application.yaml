# ================================
# Server Configuration
# ================================
server:
  port: 8081
  # The microservice will run on port 8081 instead of the default 8080.
  # Example: http://localhost:8081/api/users

# ================================
# Spring Application Configuration
# ================================
spring:
  application:
    name: USER-SERVICE
    # The name of this microservice.
    # Used for service discovery in Eureka and distributed tracing.
    # Other services will identify this as "USER-SERVICE".

  mongodb:
    uri: mongodb+srv://username:password@taskuserservice.xcpl6ae.mongodb.net/taskDB?retryWrites=true&w=majority
    # Connection URI for MongoDB Atlas cluster.
    # Includes:
    # - username: "username"
    # - password: "password" (should be replaced with a secure password in production!)
    # - cluster: taskuserservice.xcpl6ae.mongodb.net
    # - database: taskDB
    # retryWrites=true → ensures writes are retried on transient errors.
    # w=majority → ensures write acknowledgment from majority of nodes.

# ================================
# Distributed Tracing Configuration
# ================================
management:
  tracing:
    sampling:
      probability: 1.0
      # Sampling probability for tracing.
      # 1.0 → trace 100% of requests (good for debugging, but heavy in production).
  zipkin:
    tracing:
      endpoint: "http://localhost:9411/api/v2/spans"
      # Zipkin server endpoint for collecting traces.
      # Zipkin must be running locally on port 9411.
      # This allows you to visualize request flows across microservices.

# ================================
# Eureka Client Configuration
# ================================
eureka:
  client:
    service-url:
      defaultZone: http://localhost:8085/eureka
      # URL of the Eureka server (service registry).
      # This microservice will register itself with Eureka at port 8085.
      # Other microservices can discover "USER-SERVICE" via Eureka.
